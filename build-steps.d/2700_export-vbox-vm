## GATEWAY - LOW RAM? ##
########################

If your computer has 2GB or less RAM, set the RAM for Whonix-Gateway to 128MB to automatically boot into a command-line environment. The Gateway will work normally, and you can configure it via the command-line. If you need a graphical environment, temporarily increase RAM to 512MB to boot to a desktop.

## WORKSTATION LOW RAM? ##
##########################

If your computer has less than 2GB RAM, you can lower the RAM for Whonix-Workstation to 512MB. Performance will suffer, but an advanced user can install a lighter desktop environment. Setting RAM to less than 512MB will boot to a command-line environment.
