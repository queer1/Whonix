   ## controversy of:
   ## /etc/resolv.conf /etc/hosts /etc/hostname /etc/network/interfaces

   ## When we are inside chroot, we need a functional /etc/resolv.conf,
   ## otherwise DNS lookups and subsequently apt-get and curl would be defunct.
   ## On the other hand, we do not want to copy /etc/resolv.conf from the
   ## build machine into chroot, to prevent leaking personal data into chroot.
   ## Therefore we use /etc/resolv.conf from the host inside chroot,
   ## without ever writing it. (Mounting)

   ## When we are inside chroot, we need correct /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname
   ## files, otherwise commands such as:
   ##     sudo -u root echo 'This is a test echo.'
   ## would show for example
   ##     sudo: unable to resolve host debian
   ## and take a long time to complete.

   ## We need two commands to remount an existing file as read only.
   ## Thanks to: https://lwn.net/Articles/281157/
   ## Remount as read only...
   ## Does not work on Debian Wheezy.
   ## Not required anymore. We are not starting any services, DHCP or
   ## networking inside the chroot, so the file should remain untouched.
